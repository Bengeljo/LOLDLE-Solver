# LOLDLE-Solver
A little code that will solve LOLDLE, currently only the classic version.
Only in english. You need to be scrolled up for it to work.
You can check with the screenshot.png if you are perfect in the center.
I am using a 3840 x 2160 screen so you have to put your own values into the fields values.

# Why did I create it
I was playing the little quiz game on loldle.net and thought that it might be fun to write a code that could solve it.
But mainly I did it cause I want to learn to how to code since I am studying it and it is a great practice. 
First I tried to with Webscraping but since I am not very good at coding atm, I tried it with Image to Text. 
Works properly but I also made a costum model to read the font to reduce the recognizen errors.

# What is the plan for the future
I want to solve the whole quiz, if you want to help me, teach me about python or do you own stuff with it you are free to do so.
I am always happy to see people interact with stuff I created and am always willing to learn new things.
If you see something in the code that can be optimized you are free to either open up an issue or make pull requests.
