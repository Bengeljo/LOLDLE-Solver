# LOLDLE-Solver
A little code that will solve LOLDLE, currently only the classic version.
Only in english. You need to be scrolled up for it to work.
It roughly solves the classic version in 4 guesses, sometimes it gets lucky since when it gets the available champions that fit the requirements it grabs a random one.
It for sure can be improved especally the first guess since I hardcoded it to be Nasus every time since it is my fav Champ.
I hope I will find good ways to solve the rest of the quizes.
If you want to help out you can do so. 

# How to use it 
Download the code. You only need the mainscreen.py and champion.json, run the mainscreen.py and he will automatically start the work.
You can check with the screenshot.png if you are perfect in the center.
I am using a 3840 x 2160 screen so you have to put your own values into the fields values.

Look that the Results fit in that region, the y1 value can stay as it is. From there you need to change the x1 and x2 values and the y2 value for each field.

The field screenshots should look something like this.

# Why did I create it
I was playing the little quiz game on loldle.net and thought that it might be fun to write a code that could solve it.
But mainly I did it cause I want to learn to how to code since I am studying it and it is a great practice. 
First I tried to with Webscraping but since I am not very good at coding atm, I tried it with Image to Text. 
Works properly but I also made a costum model to read the font to reduce the recognizen errors.

# What is the plan for the future
I want to solve the whole quiz, if you want to help me, teach me about python or do you own stuff with it you are free to do so.
I am always happy to see people interact with stuff I created and am always willing to learn new things.
If you see something in the code that can be optimized you are free to either open up an issue or make pull requests.

You can join this Discord Server to get in contact with me, we can chat or you can show what you did with my code or show me improvments.
Maybe you solved the next quiz already and want to present it to me.
